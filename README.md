Neural Network Projects
This repository contains neural network projects that Iâ€™ve completed or am currently developing.
All Python scripts include the full implementation, and datasets are stored in the Data folder.

ðŸ“Œ Project 1 â€“ Loan Repayment Classifier (NN_paying_loan_classifier.ipynb)
Goal: Predict whether an individual will repay a loan.
Dataset: LendingClub Loan Data (Kaggle) https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Key steps:

Data analysis â€“ exploring loan data trends and patterns

Preprocessing â€“ handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features

Neural network construction â€“ designing, training, and evaluating a classification model
